* Notes: For Tierfal, polarspaz. Heyyyyy guysssss. So it's been like. A year and a half. Since I last posted a thing. Hi. I missed you. :'D I haven't been gone, just -- hibernating. I guess :'D Anyway this is the first thing of a reasonable length I've finished in god knows how long, so even though it's only moderately edited you guys get it anyway. Dedicated to Tierfal, who is a daily inspiration and blessing to me as a writer and as a human, and also to Polarspaz on Tumblr, whose vampiric au inspired this fucker. Anyway, hope you enjoy!
